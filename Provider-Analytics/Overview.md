Project 1 – Provider & Credentialing Analytics Dashboard

Business Problem

Healthcare organizations must continuously monitor provider credential validity, compliance status, and onboarding timelines. Manual tracking processes often introduce risks such as credential expirations, delayed onboarding, and limited operational visibility. Decision-makers require centralized analytical views to proactively identify compliance risks and workflow inefficiencies.

Objective

Design a data-driven analytical dashboard to evaluate provider compliance, credential expirations, and onboarding efficiency, enabling early risk detection and operational monitoring.

Analytical Focus

This project simulates a provider dataset reflecting common elements of credentialing and provider lifecycle management systems. The analysis emphasizes compliance monitoring, expiration risk detection, and operational efficiency metrics.

Key Metrics Evaluated

- Provider credential status distribution
- Upcoming credential expirations
- Compliance rate by department
- Average onboarding duration
- High-risk provider concentration

Insights & Analytical Value

The dashboard framework supports early identification of credential expiration risks, highlights operational bottlenecks, and enables leadership to monitor provider lifecycle performance through structured KPIs.

Tools & Methods Demonstrated

- SQL-style analytical thinking
- Excel-based data structuring concepts
- KPI and operational metric design
- Visualization-driven decision support

Project Context

All data used in this project is simulated and designed solely for analytical demonstration purposes.
