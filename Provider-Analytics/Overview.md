Project 1 – Provider Compliance & Peer Review Analytics Dashboard 

Business Problem

Healthcare organizations must continuously monitor provider credential validity, compliance status, and onboarding timelines. Manual tracking processes often introduce risks such as credential expirations, delayed onboarding, and limited operational visibility. Decision-makers require centralized analytical views to proactively identify compliance risks and workflow inefficiencies.

Objective

Design a data-driven analytical dashboard to evaluate provider compliance, credential expirations, and onboarding efficiency, enabling early risk detection and operational monitoring.

Analytical Focus

This project simulates a provider dataset reflecting common elements of credentialing and provider lifecycle management systems. The analysis emphasizes compliance monitoring, expiration risk detection, and operational efficiency metrics.

Key Metrics Evaluated

Compliance & Credential Health
- Credential status distribution
- Upcoming credential expirations
- Compliance rate by department

Provider Performance (OPPE)
- OPPE score distribution
- Average OPPE score by department
- Performance flag indicators

Peer Review & FPPE Monitoring
- FPPE status breakdown
- Peer review case activity
- Providers under review

Insights & Analytical Value

The dashboard framework supports early identification of credential expiration risks, highlights operational bottlenecks, and enables leadership to monitor provider lifecycle performance through structured KPIs.

Tools & Methods Demonstrated

- SQL-style analytical thinking
- Excel-based data structuring concepts
- KPI and operational metric design
- Visualization-driven decision support

Project Context

All data used in this project is simulated and designed solely for analytical demonstration purposes.
